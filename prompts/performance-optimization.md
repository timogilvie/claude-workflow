# Performance Optimization Prompt

When optimizing for performance:
- Profile first to identify actual bottlenecks
- Focus on algorithmic improvements before micro-optimizations
- Consider caching strategies for expensive operations
- Optimize database queries (indexes, query structure, N+1 problems)
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Consider async/parallel processing for independent operations
- Measure improvements with benchmarks
