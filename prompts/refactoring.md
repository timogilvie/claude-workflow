# Refactoring Prompt

When refactoring code:
- Preserve all existing functionality (no breaking changes)
- Extract magic numbers and strings into named constants
- Break down functions longer than 20 lines into smaller, focused functions
- Remove dead code and commented-out blocks
- Improve variable and function names for clarity
- Add type hints/annotations where missing
- Consolidate duplicate logic into reusable functions
- Ensure consistent code style throughout
