# Test Writing Prompt

When writing tests:
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Include tests for error conditions and exceptions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test boundary conditions (empty arrays, null values, max integers)
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on execution order
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
