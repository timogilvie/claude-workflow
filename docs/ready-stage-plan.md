# Implementation Plan: `ready` Stage and `wavemill ready <pr>`

## Overview

Add a new workflow stage named `ready` that runs after PR review and before merge. This stage will evaluate merge readiness, post a strict release-readiness verdict, detect merge conflicts, and support targeted agent re-entry for fixups.

The standalone entrypoint for this work is:

```bash
wavemill ready <pr>
```

The long-running `wavemill mill` monitor should also use the same underlying readiness engine so that post-PR checks are consistent whether they are run manually or automatically.

## Goals

- Introduce a first-class `ready` stage in the mill workflow.
- Add a standalone `wavemill ready <pr>` CLI command.
- Build a shared release-readiness engine that combines deterministic checks with planning-aware reasoning.
- Detect open-PR merge conflicts and support targeted agent re-entry to resolve them.
- Encode planning metadata needed for release readiness:
  - `database_change_risk: none | possible | required`
  - release/manual-step expectations

## Architectural Direction

### Shared core

Create a shared TypeScript library responsible for:

- loading task packet + plan context
- reading PR metadata and diff against base
- inspecting deploy/config/package-script files
- evaluating DB/schema/migration expectations
- checking for non-code release requirements
- checking GitHub mergeability / conflict state
- producing a structured verdict

This library should be used by both:

- the standalone `wavemill ready <pr>` command
- the `wavemill mill` post-PR `ready` phase

### Workflow shape

Current phase flow:

```text
routing -> planning -> coding -> review -> PR open -> merged/closed
```

Target flow:

```text
routing -> planning -> coding -> review -> ready -> merge
```

Where:

- `review` still handles self-review and PR creation
- `ready` handles merge readiness and merge-conflict remediation
- merge should not be considered safe until `ready` passes

## Stage Transition Refactor

The current phased workflow relies on a fragile combination of:

- agent-specific exit behavior inside reused tmux panes
- filesystem markers such as `.plan-approved` and `.coding-complete`
- monitor polling that infers transition safety from pane state and marker timing

That model has already produced repeated bugs across abort handling, Codex launch mode, pane readiness, and cross-phase model selection. The `ready` stage should not be added on top of the same mechanism. Instead, HOK-1174 should establish the new contract for all phased execution.

### Proposed contract

The orchestrator, not the agent, owns workflow state transitions.

Each task should persist:

- `features/<slug>/.phase-config.json`
- one controller-owned result file per stage, for example:
  - `features/<slug>/.planning-result.json`
  - `features/<slug>/.coding-result.json`
  - `features/<slug>/.review-result.json`
  - `features/<slug>/.ready-result.json`

`phase-config.json` is the canonical source for resolved per-stage configuration:

- planner model / agent / depth
- coder model / agent / depth
- reviewer model / agent / mode
- ready-stage model / agent / mode when introduced
- challenge metadata if applicable
- the effective configuration after applying overrides such as `FORCE_MODEL`

Each stage result file is written by the orchestrator after observing the stage outcome and should include:

- `status`: `running | awaiting_user | completed | aborted | failed`
- `startedAt`
- `finishedAt`
- `agent`
- `model`
- `artifacts`
- `notes` or `failureReason` when relevant

### Stage Result Artifact Schema (HOK-1192)

The schema is implemented in `shared/lib/stage-result.ts` with TypeScript types and
read/write/update helpers. A CLI wrapper at `tools/stage-result-cli.ts` allows the
shell orchestrator to manage result files without constructing JSON inline.

#### Base StageResult

```json
{
  "stage": "planning | coding | review | ready",
  "status": "running | awaiting_user | completed | aborted | failed",
  "startedAt": "2026-04-09T10:00:00Z",
  "finishedAt": "2026-04-09T10:30:00Z",
  "agent": "claude",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "notes": "Human-readable status note",
  "artifacts": { ... },
  "failureReason": "Optional failure description"
}
```

`artifacts` and `failureReason` are optional. Files written before HOK-1192
(without these fields) remain valid and are read without error.

#### Per-Stage Artifact Types

Each artifact type is identified by a `type` discriminator field.

**PlanningArtifacts** — written when planning completes:
```json
{ "type": "planning", "planFile": "plan.md", "taskPacketFile": "task-packet.md" }
```

**CodingArtifacts** — written when coding completes:
```json
{ "type": "coding", "filesChanged": 5, "linesAdded": 200, "linesRemoved": 50, "commitCount": 3 }
```

**ReviewArtifacts** — written when review completes:
```json
{ "type": "review", "prNumber": 42, "prUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42", "findingsCount": 3, "blockingIssues": 1 }
```

**ReadyArtifacts** — written when ready checks complete:
```json
{ "type": "ready", "verdict": "pass", "checksRun": 4, "checksPassed": 4, "mergeConflict": "CLEAN" }
```

All artifact fields are optional. The orchestrator writes what it knows at each
transition point.

#### Ownership Rules

- Only the **orchestrator** (`wavemill-mill.sh`) writes `.*-result.json` files.
- Agents produce work artifacts (plan.md, code, PRs); the orchestrator records the structured result after observing those artifacts.
- Agent prompts must not reference or modify stage result files.

#### CLI Usage

```bash
# Write a new result (shell orchestrator calls this)
npx tsx tools/stage-result-cli.ts write <feature_dir> <stage> <status> \
  [--agent X] [--model Y] [--notes Z] [--artifacts '{"type":"planning",...}']

# Read a result (returns JSON to stdout)
npx tsx tools/stage-result-cli.ts read <feature_dir> <stage>

# Update with merge semantics (preserves startedAt, merges patch)
npx tsx tools/stage-result-cli.ts update <feature_dir> <stage> \
  --status completed [--artifacts '...']
```

### Key design decisions

1. Agents produce work artifacts, not workflow bookkeeping.

- Planning produces `plan.md`
- Coding produces code changes, commits, and test results
- Review produces a PR
- Ready produces readiness output

The orchestrator records the structured stage result after observing those artifacts. Agents should not be responsible for emitting the final JSON state record.

2. User approval is a real stage state. *(Implemented in HOK-1193, finalized in HOK-1196)*

Planning transitions to `awaiting_user` once the plan is ready for review. User approval is recorded by the controller as a separate transition (`approve_plan()`) from planning completion, rather than inferred from `.plan-approved` alone. The planning stage lifecycle is:

```
[running] → [awaiting_user] → [completed]  (user approved via approve_plan)
                             → [failed]     (user rejected via reject_plan)
                             → [aborted]    (user aborted workflow)
```

When a stage result file exists it is authoritative. As of HOK-1196, `resolve_phase()` and controller readiness no longer fall back to `.plan-approved` or `.coding-complete`. Agents still create signal markers, but the monitor converts them into stage results before phase resolution consumes them.

3. Stage launches should use fresh execution.

Each stage should launch a fresh process or tmux window/pane instance rather than reusing a live interactive session across planning, coding, review, and ready. tmux remains a visibility/debugging layer, but not the state machine.

4. Prompts should be agent-agnostic about lifecycle.

Prompts should no longer tell agents to run `/exit`, remain in the session, or otherwise manage phase transitions manually. They should only describe the stage task and any required work artifacts. The orchestrator handles termination and progression.

5. Final contract after rollout.

- Agent signals: `.plan-approved`, `.coding-complete`, `.workflow-aborted`
- Controller state: `.{stage}-result.json` files are the sole source of truth for phase resolution
- Signal flow: agent creates marker → monitor detects marker → monitor writes stage result → `resolve_phase()` and `controllerCheckReadiness()` read stage results
- Phase flow: planning → coding → review → ready → merge or needs-attention
- Ready states: pass, warn, fail, remediation-in-progress, needs-attention

## Required Output Contract

Every ready check should emit a compact block:

```markdown
## Release Readiness
- Database impact: none | schema changed | migration required
- Migration committed: yes | no | not applicable
- Production migration application: automatic | manual | not applicable
- Env/config changes required: yes | no
- Manual release steps required: yes | no
- Merge verdict: safe | safe with manual steps | not safe

### Required actions before/after merge
- ...
```

Also track merge conflict state separately:

- `clean`
- `conflicted`
- `unknown`

## Planning Metadata Schema

Task packets and implementation plans include a `## Release Readiness` section with the following structured fields. The ready-stage engine (HOK-1176) reads these fields to compare implementation against planning expectations.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Allowed Values | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `database_change_risk` | enum | `none`, `possible`, `required` | Whether the task is expected to involve database schema changes |
| `env_changes` | list | comma-separated names or `none` | Environment variables that must be added or changed for deployment |
| `config_changes` | list | comma-separated names or `none` | Configuration file changes required for deployment |
| `manual_steps` | list | descriptive items or `none` | Manual steps required before or after merge (e.g., run migration script, update DNS) |

### Markdown Format

```markdown
## Release Readiness
- **database_change_risk**: none
- **env_changes**: none
- **config_changes**: none
- **manual_steps**: none
```

Example with populated fields:

```markdown
## Release Readiness
- **database_change_risk**: required
- **env_changes**: NEW_API_KEY, FEATURE_FLAG_X
- **config_changes**: config/production.json
- **manual_steps**: Run migration script `scripts/migrate-v2.sh`, Update CDN cache rules
```

### Parsing Rules

- `database_change_risk` must be exactly one of `none`, `possible`, or `required` (case-sensitive)
- List fields use comma-separated values; `none` maps to an empty list
- The section is optional — existing task packets without it remain valid
- Extraction returns `null` when the section is absent

## Delivery Plan

### 1. Ready stage contract and CLI skeleton

Define the new stage name (`ready`), CLI surface (`wavemill ready <pr>`), and shared result schema before wiring behavior into the monitor. This creates a stable contract for later issues.

### 2. Planning metadata for release readiness

Extend planning/task-packet generation and validation to include:

- `database_change_risk`
- release requirements / manual-step expectations

This makes the readiness gate planning-aware instead of relying on freeform prose.

### 3. Shared release-readiness engine

Implement the deterministic + synthesized checks behind a reusable library and a standalone CLI command:

- PR diff inspection
- schema / migration reconciliation
- deployment application check
- env/config/manual-step detection
- strict verdict generation

### 4. Mill integration for the `ready` phase

Teach the monitor to transition open PRs into `ready`, run the shared readiness engine, and keep the issue blocked from merge completion until the gate passes.

### 5. Merge conflict monitoring and auto-resolution handoff

Inspect open PR mergeability during the `ready` stage. When conflicts exist, re-enter the agent in the existing worktree with a narrow prompt to rebase/merge and resolve conflicts automatically, then rerun readiness.

### 6. Tests, docs, and rollout policy

Add test coverage, docs, and policy changes so the new stage is operable:

- `Do not allow user merges until ready passes`
- docs for `wavemill ready <pr>`
- monitor and review-mode documentation

## Linear Issue Breakdown

Parent issue: `HOK-1138 Create Merge Readiness Step`

### Current Status

The issue tree started executing against an earlier version of this plan before the phase-transition refactor was fully articulated:

- `HOK-1174` shipped in PR `#208`
- `HOK-1175` shipped in PR `#207`
- `HOK-1176` shipped in PR `#213`
- `HOK-1183` shipped in PR `#214`
- `HOK-1178` shipped in PR `#215`

Because of that, the stage-transition refactor described above should be treated as follow-up architectural guidance layered on top of the shipped baseline, not as a retroactive rewrite of completed issue scopes. The contract-gap work already captured in `HOK-1183` remains the bridge from the original scaffold toward a more controller-owned model.

This avoids reopening completed work or silently changing the meaning of merged PRs.

## Implementation Contract (HOK-1174)

### Type Definitions

The ready stage contract is defined in `shared/lib/ready-stage.ts`:

- `ReadyCheckStatus`: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'warn' | 'skip'
- `ReadyCheck`: Individual check result with name, status, message, details
- `ReadyResult`: Overall result with verdict, checks array, timestamp, summary
- `ReadyStageConfig`: Configuration for ready stage

### CLI Surface

Command: `wavemill ready <pr>`

Arguments:
- `<pr>`: PR number or GitHub PR URL

Options:
- `--repo-dir <path>`: Repository directory (default: current directory)

Output: JSON to stdout  
Exit codes: 0 for pass/warn, 1 for fail

### Configuration

In `.wavemill-config.json`:

```json
{
  "ready": {
    "enabled": false,  // Must be explicitly enabled
    "checks": [],      // Empty = run all available checks
    "requiredChecks": []  // Subset that must pass
  }
}
```

### Phase Boundary

**Review → Ready Transition**: Occurs when PR is opened. Review judges code quality; ready judges merge-readiness.

**Current Implementation**: The scaffold shipped in HOK-1174; follow-on issues add the engine, controller compatibility, conflict handling, and full monitor wiring.

## Handoff Boundaries

Explicit deliverables and expectations for each issue in the ready-stage chain.

### HOK-1176 → HOK-1183

**HOK-1176 delivers:**
- Shared readiness engine: `runReadyStage()` with `checkSchemaMigrations`, `checkCIStatus`, `checkReleaseRequirements`, `checkDeployPaths`
- `wavemill ready <pr>` CLI via `tools/ready.ts`
- Basic `launch_ready_phase()` shell function in `wavemill-mill.sh`

- `computeVerdict()` exported for reuse
- `getReadyConfig()` available from `shared/lib/config.ts`

### HOK-1183 → HOK-1177

**HOK-1183 delivers:**
- `controllerCheckReadiness(featureDir)` — evaluates feature directory phase state without PR/GitHub context
- `checkLegacyMarkers(featureDir)` — detects `.plan-approved`, `.coding-complete`, `.workflow-aborted` and maps to `ReadyCheck[]`
- `ControllerReadinessResult` and `LegacyMarkerResult` types

- `check_ready_stage()` shell function stub in `wavemill-mill.sh`

**HOK-1177 expects from HOK-1183:**
- `controllerCheckReadiness()` function callable from shell via `tools/controller-ready.ts`
- `check_ready_stage()` shell function defined with stable interface
- Phase detection logic that maps markers to `planning | coding | review | ready | aborted | unknown`

### HOK-1177 → HOK-1182

**HOK-1177 delivers:**
- Phase transition wiring: orchestrator calls `check_ready_stage()` at transition points
- Ready-phase blocking: merge completion gated on readiness pass
- State persistence for ready-stage results in workflow state JSON

**HOK-1182 expects from HOK-1177:**
- Phase transitions working end-to-end in `wavemill mill`
