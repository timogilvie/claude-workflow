Wavemill helps developers build software more effectively with LLMs. It connects a backlog in Linear with tools to plan and build faster. Wavemill supports using Linear as backlog planner and Claude/Codex as implementation agents but makes it easy to extend to other tools. 

## What Wavemill Handles

- Pulls prioritized tasks from Linear.
- Expands thin issues into implementation-ready packets.
- Runs parallel agent worktrees with conflict safeguards.
- Tracks PR and workflow progress with validation gates.

## Core Modes

### 1) Autonomous mill mode

Use `wavemill mill` to continuously process backlog tasks in parallel. 

### 2) Epic planning

Use `wavemill plan` to break an epic/larger body of work into chunks that LLMs can handle and add them as Linear tasks that can be milled later.

### 3) Human-in-the-loop workflow

Use workflow commands to move one feature from backlog to PR with explicit review gates.
