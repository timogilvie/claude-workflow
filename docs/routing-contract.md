# Routing Contract

This note documents the current Wavemill routing lifecycle and the runtime contract for bootstrap routing, expanded routing, and the authoritative execution route.

## Purpose

- Document where routing is produced, persisted, reread, and archived today.
- Define the target lifecycle boundary between pre-expansion routing and post-expansion execution routing.
- Identify the exact controller handoff where expanded routing must be promoted before coding and review.

## Non-Goals

- No change to challenge-mode pairing semantics or operator overrides such as `FORCE_MODEL`.
- No change to the underlying routing policy or expanded-route cache keying.

## Scoring Format Requirement

Route artifacts used for Wavemill router benchmark scoring must be strict JSON files. Runtime readers may remain lenient and classify malformed artifacts as `invalid_route`, but benchmark inputs are only scoreable when the artifact parses as JSON and contains the required route fields.

## Current Lifecycle

### Startup Runner

`shared/lib/wavemill-startup-runner.sh::startup_run_task_phases` writes `features/<slug>/.routing-complete` from the startup-selected planner/coder/reviewer/depth values and copies that file to `features/<slug>/.initial-route.json`. It then persists the same routed stage settings into `.wavemill/workflow-state.json` before launching planning.

### Dynamic Multi-Select Launch

`shared/lib/wavemill-mill.sh::prepare_route_input_for_issue` builds a minimal routing packet from `selected-task.json` when available, otherwise from the raw Linear title and description. `batch_route_selected_tasks()` routes those packets in batch and `apply_route_json_for_issue()` writes `/tmp/${SESSION}-${ISSUE}-route.json` plus `/tmp/${SESSION}-${ISSUE}-route-source.txt`. Later, `launch_task()` consumes that cached `/tmp` route or reroutes live, writes `features/<slug>/.routing-complete`, copies it to `.initial-route.json`, stores stage fields in task state, and launches planning.

### Planning Expansion

`tools/prompts/planning-phase.md` instructs the planner to route the expanded `task-packet.md` and save the result as `features/<slug>/.post-expansion-route.json`. The controller now promotes that artifact, or falls back to `features/<slug>/.expanded-route.json`, before coding launches and before a coding-phase resume relaunch.

### Routing-To-Planning Transition

The bootstrap route is what planning launches with. In startup and dynamic flows, the controller persists the pre-expansion route into `.routing-complete`, `.initial-route.json`, and task state before the planning agent starts.

### Planning-To-Coding Transition

In `shared/lib/wavemill-mill.sh`, the `planning)` branch checks `resolved_phase == "coding"`, validates the planning output, records plan approval, batch-reroutes any eligible expanded packets through `tools/route-tasks.ts --expanded-jsonl`, applies any valid expanded route artifact into `.routing-complete`, `.phase-config.json`, and workflow state, then reads coding model and depth and launches coding. This is the authoritative promotion point.

### Coding-To-Review Transition

The `coding)` branch reads reviewer model and mode from `.phase-config.json` or task state, calls `set_task_phase "$ISSUE" "review"`, and launches `launch_review_phase()`. Because the planning handoff now rewrites those execution surfaces first, review inherits the expanded reviewer and review mode automatically.

### Challenge Mode

Challenge selection now records an explicit decision source. Startup and early launch still use the bootstrap route when no expanded artifact exists. Once planning emits `.post-expansion-route.json`, `resolve-challenge-task.ts` compares bootstrap and expanded route context and either refreshes challenge participants from the expanded route, or preserves the bootstrap pair with a recorded rationale when the route did not change materially. Eval records may persist both bootstrap and expanded route snapshots through `challengeRouteContext`.

### Resume Behavior

Resume uses persisted execution state plus cache-aware expanded reroute when needed. `detect_inflight_tasks()` reads `.wavemill/workflow-state.json`, `_restore_inflight_task_window_if_missing()` relaunches planning or coding from `.phase-config.json` first and task state second, and coding relaunch now refreshes `.post-expansion-route.json` through the expanded reroute helper before promoting it. Unchanged packets hit cache or reuse the existing artifact; changed packets reroute fresh.

### Eval Artifact Archival

`archive_stage_artifacts()` copies `features/<slug>/.initial-route.json` to `.wavemill/evals/artifacts/<issue>/initial-route.json`, `features/<slug>/.routing-complete` to `.wavemill/evals/artifacts/<issue>/routing-complete.json`, and `features/<slug>/.post-expansion-route.json` to `.wavemill/evals/artifacts/<issue>/post-expansion-route.json`. Eval loading prefers live worktree artifacts and falls back to the archive copy so later summaries can compare bootstrap, expanded, and active execution routes after worktree cleanup.

## Target Lifecycle

### Bootstrap Route

The bootstrap route is the route produced from raw Linear issue fields, `selected-task.json`, or any other pre-expanded packet representation. It exists only to launch planning and early challenge preparation.

If a Linear description already contains unusually rich detail, the route is still a bootstrap route until planning completes and a post-expansion route is captured.

### Expanded Route

The expanded route is the route produced from `task-packet.md` after planning expansion and saved as `.post-expansion-route.json`. If that file does not exist, the controller may use `.expanded-route.json` as a backward-compatible fallback.

Expanded route artifacts may additionally include:

- `cache_hit`
- `route_source` with values `cache`, `batch`, or `single`
- `packet_hash` as a 64-character SHA-256 hex digest

If planning fails, expansion is incomplete, or the discovered expanded-route artifact is malformed or missing required execution fields, no promotion occurs. The controller emits an `expanded route invalid` warning and execution remains on the previously persisted bootstrap route.

## Route Lifecycle Logs

Operator-facing routing logs use the stable prefix `route.lifecycle:`. Dashboards and parsers should key on the prefix plus `event=...`, not on older free-form phrases such as `Workflow route recovered from batch cache`.

Current event names:

- `bootstrap_assigned`: bootstrap route persisted to `.routing-complete` and `.initial-route.json`
- `expanded_assigned`: valid expanded route promoted or confirmed for execution
- `expansion_cache_hit`: expanded reroute reused cached packet-hash output
- `expansion_skipped`: expanded reroute skipped — `reason=disabled`, `reason=not_eligible`, or `reason=routing_error_using_existing_artifact` (routing call failed but a pre-existing artifact was found and used)
- `expansion_failed`: expanded reroute or promotion failed with `reason=routing_error`, `reason=invalid_artifact`, or `reason=cache_error`
- `execution_active`: route actually used for coding execution, with `source=bootstrap|expanded|preserved`

Common fields:

- `issue=<LINEAR_ID>`
- `route="coder=...,codeDepth=...,reviewer=...,reviewMode=..."`
- `bootstrap_route="..."`
- `expanded_route="..."`
- `active_route="..."`
- `route_changed=true|false`
- `packet_hash=<sha256>`
- `source=batch|single|cache|bootstrap|expanded|preserved`

## Expansion Handshake Gate

At plan-to-code transition, the controller now enforces an expansion handshake:

- If `task-packet.md` already looks like a full task packet, the transition passes.
- If it is raw issue text, a valid `features/<slug>/.post-expansion-route.json` must exist.
- If the route artifact is missing or invalid, the transition is blocked by default.

Policy is controlled by `.wavemill-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mill": {
    "expansionHandshake": {
      "policy": "block"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `policy` to `"warn"` to log and continue instead of blocking.

When blocked, the controller logs the missing artifact reason and clears `.plan-approved` so resume does not auto-advance. Recovery flow:

1. Run `wavemill expand <ISSUE>`.
2. Re-approve planning by touching `.plan-approved`.

### Authoritative Execution Route

The authoritative execution route is the route consumed by coding, review, resume, challenge follow-on behavior, and eval context that claims to represent the execution workflow.

- Before expansion succeeds, the authoritative execution route is the bootstrap route.
- After expansion succeeds, the authoritative execution route must equal the expanded route.
- `FORCE_MODEL` remains a higher-priority operator override than either persisted route.

## Authoritative Promotion Point

The required promotion point is the planning-to-coding controller handoff in `shared/lib/wavemill-mill.sh` when the `planning)` branch sees `resolved_phase == "coding"`.

Ordering at that handoff:

1. Validate planning output and approval state.
2. Refresh eligible expanded packets through the batch/cache reroute helper.
3. If `.post-expansion-route.json` or `.expanded-route.json` is valid, promote it to the authoritative execution route, preferring `.post-expansion-route.json`.
4. Persist that promoted route into the execution-state surfaces used by later phases.
5. Only then read coding model and depth.
6. Only then call `set_task_phase "$ISSUE" "coding"`.
7. Only then call `launch_coding_phase()`.

Promotion updates the surfaces that coding, review, resume, and eval treat as execution state: `.routing-complete`, `.phase-config.json`, and `.wavemill/workflow-state.json`.

## Field Mutability

### Immutable / Provenance Fields

| Classification | Fields | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| immutable | issue id, slug, original Linear issue id, bootstrap snapshot in `.initial-route.json`, challenge pair identity | Expansion must not rewrite bootstrap evidence or pair identity. |
| mutable-after-expansion | planner, coder, reviewer, planDepth, codeDepth, reviewRecommended or reviewMode, expectedSuccess, confidence, expectedCost, routingMode, neighborCount, signals, reasoning, challengeRecommendation | These fields may change when the richer task packet changes the route. |
| derived | resolved agent commands, `.phase-config.json` stage blocks, task-state execution fields, eval conversion fields | These should be regenerated from the authoritative execution route rather than treated as independent source-of-truth inputs. |

Special case: challenge entries may intentionally keep distinct coder models for primary and challenger. Expanded-route promotion must not erase challenge identity. Unless a future implementation explicitly changes that rule, planner, reviewer, and depth values for both sides should follow the authoritative execution route while challenger coder override remains allowed.

## Resume And Archival Contract

Resume should reconstruct active execution from the authoritative route persisted in `.phase-config.json` and `.wavemill/workflow-state.json`, while retaining `.initial-route.json` and `.post-expansion-route.json` as provenance artifacts.

Resume should not re-run expensive expanded routing for unchanged packets. It may refresh the expanded route helper on coding relaunch, but unchanged packets must reuse the persisted artifact or the expanded-route cache by `packet_hash` and operating mode.

Eval archival now retains `initial-route.json`, `routing-complete.json`, and `post-expansion-route.json` so later analysis can compare bootstrap-to-expanded drift without a live worktree.

Eval schema `1.18.0` adds optional `routeProvenance`:

```json
{
  "routeProvenance": {
    "bootstrapRoute": { "coder": "…", "codeDepth": "…", "reviewer": "…", "reviewMode": "…" },
    "expandedRoute": { "coder": "…", "codeDepth": "…", "reviewer": "…", "reviewMode": "…" },
    "activeRoute": { "coder": "…", "codeDepth": "…", "reviewer": "…", "reviewMode": "…" },
    "routeChanged": true,
    "decisionSource": "expanded",
    "expandedCacheHit": false,
    "packetHash": "<sha256>",
    "routeSource": "batch"
  }
}
```

## Current Vs Target Summary

| Surface | Current behavior | Target behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startup runner | Writes bootstrap route to `.routing-complete` and `.initial-route.json` before planning. | Same bootstrap behavior, but clearly scoped as planning-launch input and provenance. |
| dynamic launch | Uses `/tmp` route cache or live route on raw/minimal packet, then writes `.routing-complete` and `.initial-route.json`. | Same bootstrap capture, followed by later promotion if expansion succeeds. |
| planning expansion | Writes `.post-expansion-route.json` only. | Writes `.post-expansion-route.json`, and the controller promotes it before coding/review execution begins. |
| expanded reroute | Single-task planner-owned route write. | Controller-owned cache-aware reroute that batches misses, falls back per-task, and tags artifacts with `cache_hit`, `route_source`, and `packet_hash`. |
| coding and review launch | Read `.phase-config.json` or task state, which may still reflect bootstrap routing. | Read authoritative execution state derived from the promoted expanded route. |
| challenge mode | Uses launch-time route and persists challenge-specific overrides. | Preserve distinct coder identities, refresh or preserve the pair from explicit bootstrap-versus-expanded routing context, and record the decision source for evals. |
| resume | Relaunches from `.phase-config.json` or task state, even if they still hold bootstrap values. | Relaunches from the promoted authoritative route, keeping bootstrap and expanded artifacts only as provenance. |
| eval archival | Archives both `.routing-complete` and `.post-expansion-route.json`, but loads only `.routing-complete` as routing decision. | Preserve both artifacts and make the bootstrap-versus-expanded distinction explicit for later analysis. |
